# Code

### Frontend

Vue JS instead of React or Angular2 to ease and speed up learning process and structural changes.
Vue-Router for URL management in javascript.
Vuex for Store Management (Flux pattern).
Axios for HTTP requests for the browser or node. (fetch does not provide significant advantages and no wrapper are powerful enought)
D3 JS for charts to ensure a wide range of customization + community support.
Plottable on top of D3 to normalize and speed up graphs grouping, axis drawing, text positionning, interactions such as bruch + tooltip.

### Tool chain

Git to version
Github to store code
Github Pages to expose app static files (ease of use, propagation speed)
100-m/m100-skeleton as a base for all frontend repositories
vbrajon/vmake to run, build and deploy code (source code repositories are separated from build system repository)
