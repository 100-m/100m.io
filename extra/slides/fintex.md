# Fintex

## Analytics and Datavisualization Application

---

# The *goal of the analysis* is:

1. To *monitor Auxmoney underwriting*.
2. To *benchmark Fintex’s allocation* within the Auxmoney portfolio, and verify it has the same statistical properties as the wider Auxmoney portfolio, i.e. there is “*no bias*” in Fintex’s allocation.
3. To compare Auxmoney *performance vs. their forecasts*.
4. To compute *predicted default rates and estimated returns* on FinTex bonds.

You would like an interactive application that *automates the analysis* and presents the results in a *user-friendly & visual format*.
